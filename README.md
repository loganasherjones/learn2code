# Learn2Code

If you want to learn how to code, this repository is for you. My name is
Logan Asher Jones and I've decided to start a personal project called 
Learn2Code.

The plan is to stream on twitch https://twitch.tv/loganasherjones

During the Learn2Code streams, I'll be answering questions from the community.
The questions/examples can be any level. During the streams I'll be doing
a Q&A so that questions from the community get answered.

If you missed a stream, don't worry. I'll be posting the stream to YouTube
where you can watch. In addition, the code generated from the live stream 
will be in this repository for you to view.
