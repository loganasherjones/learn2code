## Topic Request
**What would you like to learn about?**

<!-- 
First, thank you so much for wanting to contribute! I do read all of these and want to make sure
you have the best chance to get your topics selected. Before you submit your topic, I would very much appreciate if you could look through the issues to make sure no one has suggested your topic before.

Topics should be about programming, but they can be any part of programming.
The topics can be anything (basic, intermediate, advanced, best practices):
* How do I write a function?
* What is a byte?
* How do I use GitHub?
* How do I contribute to Open Source?
* How do I create a Kubernetes component?
* How do I write a chatbot?
--->

* I want to learn about... (e.g. functions/lists/arrays etc)

**Idea for using your topic**

<!---
Good and interesting ideas are a great way to get your topic picked. The hardest part for me is figuring out how I'm going to demonstrate a topic and make it useful. If you can provide an example of a result you'd like to see from this lesson it does two things:

1. It makes the lesson better (at the very least for you) because you will get something you're interested in from it.
2. It makes it that much more likely that I'll choose it.

* I want to write a function that adds two numbers together.

**Preferred Language**

* Python, Go, Java, C, C++, Don't care
